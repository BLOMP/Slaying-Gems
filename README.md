# Slaying Gems

*Will probably change the name to "Gem Slayer" or similar after the contest...*

- **Setting:** European Feudalpunk
- A king has asked our protagonist, **The Laser Knight** to retrieve a collection of the kingdom's gems from an evil sorcerer.
- Little does **The Laser Knight** know, the sorcerer is actually a pretty cool guy, and those gems have belonged to his family for generations.
- **The Laser Knight** is able to easily take the gems as the sorcerer is out on holiday, but when the sorcerer gets back, he realizes that the king must have done it. As punishment, the sorcerer turns the entire kingdom in an amalgamation of gems.
- Realizing what they have done **The Laser Knight** begins their quest to return the gems, only the kingdom's soldiers, monsters, and denizens are not too keen on making it easy for them.
